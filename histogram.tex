\section{Histogram}
We compare different error metric for histogram in two figures:
Figure 1: PSNR plot for all histogram streams using different error metrics.

Figure 2: histogram plots for each metric, at some low bit rate

Figure 3: RMSE error between rmse stream and histogram stream for one data set

Figure 4: Histogram error for the  above two streams for the same data set.

To somewhat quantify the differences of two streams, we define the concept of a stream signature, and present the algorithm to compute a signature.

Algorithm. How to compute a stream's signature.

We show the two signatures for rmse and histogram streams for the same data set.

Figure 5: show signature of the two streams

Figure 6: show signatures for different number of bins

Figure 7: Show that we can stream using the histogram signature to get better histogram than rmse
