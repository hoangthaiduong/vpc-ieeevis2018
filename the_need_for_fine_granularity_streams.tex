\section{The need for fine-granularity streams}
We begin by defining what we mean by resolution and precision. Things to touch on here:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item that we use the (cdf5/3) wavelet transform to generate levels of resolution (subbands)
  \item that due to computational contraint, and also because of practical reasons, we group wavelet coefficients into groups of 4x4 (and in some cases 8x8 or 16x16 if the data is large).
  \item we quantize the data to 16 bits by extracting the maximum exponent
  \item we use negabinary to avoid having to deal with the sign bit in a special way
\end{enumerate}

Here we argue that streaming by bit planes or streaming by levels result in sub-optimal PSNR (figure \ref{fig:psnr_traditional_vs_by_norm_viscosity}a)

	\caption {PSNR comparison between three streams: by bit-plane, by level, and by wavelet norm}
	\label{fig:psnr_traditional_vs_by_norm_viscosity}
\end{figure}

When compression is used, it avoids streaming the leading zero bits of the wavelet coefficients (figure \ref{fig:psnr_traditional_vs_by_norm_viscosity}b).

In the supplement materials, we show the same plot for the following datasets:
Datasets:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Miranda viscosity (smooth and uniform)
  \item Kingsnake (noisy and sparse)
  \item Magnetic (tiny narrow lines)
  \item Euler 2D (sharp front)
  \item Enzo u (wide range)
\end{enumerate}

The reader may ask: if I already have a good, practical PSNR stream (the data-independent, by bit plane, skip leading zeros), why do I need other streams? Here we show that for isocontour extraction, and for histogram computation, we are better off with other streams.
  
Figure: isocontour error for the same data set (Figure \ref{fig:by_bit_plane_isocontour})
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Data-dependent stream for isocontour with skip leading zeros
  \item Data-dependent stream for isocontour with skip leading zeros, also with by-bit-plane constraint
\end{enumerate}

We also need to show a rendering of the two isocontours for these streams at some low bit rate.
Figure: histogram error for the same data set
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Data-dependent stream for histogram with skip leading zeros
  \item Data-dependent stream for histogram with skip leading zeros, also with by-bit-plane constraint
\end{enumerate}  
  Here we also show renderings of different histograms corresponding to the different streams at some low bit rate.
