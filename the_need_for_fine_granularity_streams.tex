\section{The need for fine-granularity streams (existing techniques)}
Multiresolution data structures or value quantization are commmonly used for data size
reduction.

However, we show that by both reducing resolution and precision we can achieve lower error
than by limiting the reduction only to resolution or only to precision. For our experiments
we use wavelets, where the resolution corresponds to levels, and precision to bitplanes.

For example, we can compute {\em PSNR} for a relatively smooth and uniform dataset, such as Miranda
viscosity field, and vary only resolution, only precision, or both (\Cref{fig:viscosity-psnr}). Miranda
dataset is especially useful as the independent stream order does not exhibit any spatial adaptivity and
this particular datasets is fairly uniform.

The resolution stream loads level-by-level data with full precision resulting in notable flat regions. These
regions are coused by the doubling of the samples at each refinement step. Similarly, the precision stream
shows the similar staircase pattern, but in this case the flat regions are smaller as the bitplane granularity
is finer than in the resolution stream case. The combination of both these approaches outperform precision
stream at all times and its finer granularity.

                 precision, and both resolution and precision.}
        \label{fig:viscosity-psnr}
\end{figure}



Here we argue that streaming by bit planes or streaming by levels result in sub-optimal PSNR.
List of experiments to run:

We compare data-independent streams. Figure 1: PSNR comparison for a data set (Miranda viscosity?)
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Data-independent, by-bit-plane stream (truncation stream)
      \item Data-independent, by-level stream (idx style, mipmap)
      \item Data-independent, by-bit-importance stream
    \end{enumerate}


Datasets:

\begin{enumerate}
        \item Miranda viscosity (smooth and uniform)
        \item Kingsnake (noisy and sparse)
        \item Magnetic (tiny narrow lines)
        \item Euler 2D (sharp front)
        \item Enzo u (wide range)
\end{enumerate}



\section{Data-dependent streams}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First we compare data-dependent streams. Figure 2: PSNR comparison for the same data set
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Data-dependent, by-bit-plane stream with constraints on bit plane ordering
    \item Data-dependent, by-level stream with constraints on bit plane ordering
    \item Data-dependent stream with constraints on bit plane ordering
    \item Data-dependent, by-bit-plane stream with skip leading zeros
    \item Data-dependent, by-level stream with skip leading zeros
    \item Data-dependent stream with skip leading zeros
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The reader may ask: if I already have a good, practical PSNR stream (the data-independent, by bit plane, skip leading zeros), why do I need other streams? Here we show that for isocontour extraction, and for histogram computation, we are better off with other streams.
  
  Figure 3: isocontour error for the same data set
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Data-independent, by-bit-plane, normalized, skip leading zeros
      \item Data-dependent stream for RMSE with skip leading zeros
      \item Data-dependent stream for isocontour with skip leading zeros
    \end{enumerate}
  We also need to show a rendering of the isocontour for all three streams at some low bit rate.
  Figure 4: histogram error for the same data set
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Data-independent, by-bit-plane, normalized, skip leading zeros
      \item Data-dependent stream for RMSE with skip leading zeros
      \item Data-dependent stream for isocontour with skip leading zeros
  \end{enumerate}  
  Here we also show renderings of different histograms corresponding to the different streams at some low bit rate.
\end{enumerate}
