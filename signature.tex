\section{Stream signatures and hybrid streams}

\subsection{Stream signatures}
To capture the core characteristics of the \emph{laplacian-optimized} stream, we introduce the
concept of a stream \emph{signature}. A signature is a matrix with $B$ columns and $L$ rows, with
$B$ being the number of bit planes in the data set, and $L$ being the number of subbands in the
wavelet transform. Each cell $(b,l)$ in the signature matrix contains a value in the range
$[0,B\times L)$, and the ordering of these values reflects the relative ordering in which the $b$
bit on subband $l$ (for all $l$ and $b$) appear in the stream, on average. The signatures for

The algorithm used to compute a signature from a stream is presented below (TODO: placeholder).

\subsection{Hybrid streams}

To do so, we construct \emph{hybrid} streams that combines two given streams (the relative order
matters). For example, the \emph{hybrid isocontour-rmse} combines \emph{isocontour-optimized} and
\emph{rmse-optimized} in a way such that within a region, it has the same chunk ordering as that of
\emph{rmse-optimized}'s, but globally, it visits the regions in the same order that
\emph{isocontour-optimized} does. Another hybrid stream that can be formed is \emph{hybrid
rmse-isocontour}, which is form similarly to how \emph{hybrid isocontour-rmse} is formed, but with
its two input streams switching roles. Since a hybrid stream is designed to retain the
characteristics of the first stream locally (within a region), it can be used as a proxy of the
second stream for comparison against the first. The \emph{hybrid isocontour-rmse} stream can be
compared with \emph{isocontour-optimized}, and the \emph{hybrid rmse-isocontour} stream can be
compared with \emph{rmse-optimized}. Figure \ref{fig:isocontour-plots} provides these comparisons.
