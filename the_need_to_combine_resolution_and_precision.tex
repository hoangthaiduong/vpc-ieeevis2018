Traditional data reduction techniques work in either resolution space or precision space
exclusively. They truncate either the last few levels in a multi-resolution representation of the
data, or the last few low-ordered bits, but rarely both. Our aim in this section is to show that
significant gain can be achieved when one combines both dimensions of data reduction. To do so, we
construct and compare different ways to order the bits of a data set so that bits that have higher
impact on the error (in regards to a metric of interest) appear earlier. We call each ordering a
\emph{stream} of bits. The idea is that, if the data is streamed to a receiver using a bit ordering
that is optimized for a certain metric, the receiver would be able to perform analysis tasks
pertaining to that metric as soon as possible, while incurring minimal error.


\note{This paragraph is difficult to follow and comprehend for
  non-compression people. Can we make a figure somehow ?} Streams are
not constructed from raw data bits, but from a representation in which
every bit can be associated with a resolution level and a bit
plane. \ptb{I think the argument needs to be inverted. ``To associate
  bits to resolution and bit planes we transform the data ...''
  Somehow this also has to do with the fact that we need some other
  basis in which to represent the data. So abother way of starting
  this argument is that the naive approach of literally using raw bits
  of different floating point number is stupid. Instead we make the
  ``obvious'' transformation into some better basis.} We use the
CDF5/3 wavelet transform [CITE] to decompose the domain into
resolution levels (also known as subbands). To handle precision in a
unified way, we quantize the resulting wavelet coefficients to
$16$-bit signed integers \ptb{why does quantization lead to a unified
  way ?}, which are then converted to negabinary form [CITE]\ptb{Why ?
  Either you need to tell me shorty why this makes sense or tell me
  later on when you can tell me that negabinary has advantages}. In
each subband, negabinary coefficients are grouped into groups of
$g \times g$ in 2D, and each group is divided into \emph{chunks}
\ptb{This is very hard to parse ... I doubt many people will have a
  feel for what a subband is nor understand why you first tell be
  about groups and then chunks. If we only process chunks ... why do I
  need to know about groups ?}. A chunk contains a single bit plane of
all coefficients in the group. \ptb{If a chunk contains the bitplane
  than a group is not ``divided'' into chunks since at least to me
  ``divided implies some spatial grouping in this context. ... maybe
  we call each bitplane of a group a chunk and these will be the
  fundamental units of data ...} For performance reasons, we do not
stream one bit at a time, but always one chunk at a time (a typical
group size used in this paper is $4 \times 4, thus each chunk is of 16$ bits;\ptb{Hmm, 4x4
  is not the chunk size but the group size ... at least if I
  underestand the definitions above correctly}
  We used $16 \times 16$ group size for data dependent streams (the streams are
  almost identical) to accelerate the optimization process.\ptb{Why do we use different group
  sizes ? If we really need to I would make this a positive. ... We
  found that different group sizes can make a difference with data
  dependent stream perfoming better for larger group sizes as they
  allow to better predict .....}
  
  This constraint is reasonable
because in practice, data is almost never read or written bit-by-bit.

\ptb{This feels like a subsection to me and probbaly needs the
  corresponding ``intro'' sentence. Also reading the rest of the
  section I realized that it focuses entirely on PSNR as metric and
  that is what it distinguishes it from Section 4. But that is not
  clear from the text at all. Maybe the entire section should be title
  Task-Independent Streams and the next one Task Dependent Streams or
  something similar. Also in that case I would move the discussion
  below on how we evaliuate to earlier.}  Of the streams to be
compared, one proceeds strictly from coarser to finer resolution
levels (\emph{by level}), one proceeds stricly from higher-ordered to
lower-ordered bit planes (\emph{by bit plane}), and one combines
resolution and precision (\emph{by wavelet norm}). The \emph{by
  levels} stream is designed to represent the way data is read in
traditional multi-resolution techniques such as those based on
subsampling~\cite{idx2001}, octrees~\cite{multires_octree1999}, or
wavelets [CITE]. The \emph{by bit plane} stream represents techniques
that truncate data in precision such as zfp~\cite{zfp2014}.  The
\emph{by wavelet norm} sort chunks in decreasing order of
$\norm{W_l}_2 \times 2^b$, where $l$ and $b$ are a chunk's subband and
bit plane, and $W_l$ is the wavelet basis function at subband $l$.
These three streams are data-independent. We also include in the
comparison two data-dependent streams, namely
\emph{resolution-adaptive} and \emph{fully adaptive}. In the
\emph{resolution-adaptive} stream, chunks are ordered so as to
minimize peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR [CITE]), with one
constraint: every wavelet coefficients must come in full precision (in
other words, chunks of the same group are streamed together). The
\emph{fully adaptive} stream orders chunks to minimize PSNR the same
way, but without any constraints. Both streams are constructed using
the greedy algorithm discussed in~\Cref{sec:data_dep_streams}.

\ptb{This paragraph almost feels liek a result/experiment section
  since it talks about exactly how we setup the tests ... This feels a
  bit weird in this section. What do you want this section to be ?
  Background ? High level overview ? Experimental design ?}
For each stream, everytime a chunk is received, the data is reconstructed at full resolution using
only the chunks received so far. An error value is then computed, depending on the metric used
(e.g., PSNR, histogram error, isocontour error, etc). For the $512 \times 512$, double-precision
data set \emph{Magnetic} [REF], Figure \ref{fig:motivation} compares the five streams in
PSNR relative to the original (unquantized) data. We note that for this particular comparison,
chunks containing only leading zero bits are removed for all streams, to mimic the effect of entropy
compression in practice.

	approximately translates to one more decimal digit of accuracy.}

\ptb{This description of the results feels very minimalistic to me
  ... afterall this discussion is the entire punch line for this
  section and why you made me read the rest. Also I can't read the
  text i nthe figures}
It can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:motivation} that the streams that combine resolution and
precision (\emph{by wavelet norm} and \emph{fully adaptive}) perform the best, either among the
data-independent streams, or the data-dependent ones. This result is true across all four data sets shown,
and for all other data sets in our experiments. The \emph{fully adaptive} stream, can be thought of
as an empirical upper bound on how well any stream of the same data can perform in terms of PSNR. Of
the data-independent streams, \emph{by bit plane} approximates \emph{by wavelet norm}  well, but this
is true only when the error metric is PSNR. In the next section, we show that because of its greater
flexibility, the \emph{by wavelet norm} stream outperforms \emph{by bit plane} by a large margin
when it comes to computing an accurate histogram.

%\section{The need for task-optimized streams}
%
%\ptb{I would almost never suggest a section this short. How is this
%  not sipmly the ``motivation'' subsection of the next section ?}
%To test whether a stream that is suited to a certain task (function reconstruction, using PSNR as
%the metric) also performs well in another (histogram computation), we compare the streams introduced
%in the previous section using a histogram error metric that is the Earth Mover Distance (EMD)~\cite{emd1998}.
%The EMD measures how far the histogram of the reconstructed data is from the histogram of
%the original data. We use 256 histogram bins in all experiments. The results are shown in Figure
%\ref{fig:histogram-motivation}. Compared to Figure \ref{fig:motivation}, the \emph{by level} stream
%is removed and two other streams are added: \emph{resolution-adaptive, EMD-optimized} and
%\emph{fully adaptive, EMD-optimized}. The two new streams are analogous to their RMSE counterparts
%(i.e., the two data-dependent streams in Figure \ref{fig:motivation}, now renamed to
%\emph{resolution-adaptive, RMSE-optimized} and \emph{fully adaptive, RMSE-optimized}), but are
%computed by greedily minimizing EMD instead of RMSE with regards to the ground truth.

%	end where the errors become negligibly small.}
%	\label{fig:histogram-motivation}
%\end{figure}
%
%The \emph{by bit plane} and \emph{by wavelet norm} streams match one another closely in terms of
%PSNR, but differ significantly in EMD. Furthermore, the \emph{fully adaptive, RMSE-optimized} stream
%underperforms  \emph{fully adaptive, EMD-optimized}, indicating that recontructing an accurate
%function and reconstructing an accurate histogram require two very different orderings of bits.
%Figure \ref{fig:histogram-comparison} illustrates how a quantitative difference in EMD translates to
%a visual difference in histogram.
