Visualization and Analysis Platform for Ocean, Atmosphere, and Solar Researchers
(VAPOR)~\cite{multires_toolkit2003, vapor2007} incorporates a multiresolution file
format to allow data analysis on commodity hardware. The data format is based on
wavelet transform with each level stored in separate files to allow partial access.
The authors only leverage the resolution control without exploring the precision axis
(TODO: at least it seems from looking at those papers, I did not check their code).
