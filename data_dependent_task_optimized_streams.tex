\section{Data-dependent task-optimized streams}
Here we discuss the problem of finding the ``best'' stream for the analysis task at hand. This problem is hard because it is hard to define the notion of ``best''. We will attempt at defining ``best'' in terms of minimizing the error with each bit read. However actually programming the optimization this way will result in a sub-optimal stream because it is necessary to sometimes lose in the short term to then gain more later on. This fact means that we can't optimize for bit budget A and then claim that that solution is also an optimal sub-solution for budget B > A.

Then our next attempt is another $O(n^2)$ scheme where we attempt to maximize the error difference with each bit (Scheme1)

Detail Algorithm for Scheme1.

Yet another way to optimize is the $O(n)$ scheme where we start with every bit and then turn each off and measure the impact on error. Then we sort every bit by its impact (Scheme2).

Detail Algorithm for Scheme2.

We show a figure comparing Scheme1 and Scheme2 on PSNR, histogram, and isocontour for two datasets.
