\section{3D Results}
\label{sec:3d_results}

In previous sections, we showed that changing the streaming order can significantly reduce error. For example,
adaptive RMSE optimized stream outperforms any fixed ordering stream, such as by level,
by bit plane, or by wavelet norm. We now validate those result on the full 3D datasets.
Since, the data sets are much larger, for
practical reason we had increase the group size from $4^2$ to $16^3$.

We start with reproducing the experiment comparing streaming the data \emph{by level}, \emph{by bit plane},
and \emph{by wavelet norm} (\Cref{fig:motivation-3d-rmse}). In 2D experiments, all data set exhibited the by level stream
being the worst, then by bit plane, and the best was by wavelet norm (REF). The 3D results are different as
the by level and by bit plane orders cross. The cause is that the by bit plane stream reads one bit plane for whole
dataset, but many of those will be zero and thus not contribute to the error reduction (TODO SLZ). In contrast, the by
level stream will read low subbands first and in most cases reduced the error as it is common that most energy is stored in
the these subbands.
