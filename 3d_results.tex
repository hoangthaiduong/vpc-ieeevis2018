\section{3D Results}
We extend our comparison to 3D miranda viscosity dataset, to further validate the approach.
Due to computation cost we primarily focus on two streams, {\em by wavelet norm} and {\em fully
adaptive}, as we showed in previous sections (TODO: refer to them) that these two streams represent
well the non-adaptive and adaptive chunk ordering.

Miranda simulation consists of whatever and the volume has large portions empty
(Figure to DVR image maybe).

We computed streams for the three primary queries, l2norm, histogram, and isosurface. The only
major code change was related to the isosurface query as the area instead of length is needed.
We used piecewise linear approximation to the isosurface extracted with Marching Cubes algorithm
(TODO: or remove it as those guys have enough references already).
