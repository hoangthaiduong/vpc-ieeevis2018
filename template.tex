%% Abstract section.
\abstract{Performing scientific analysis on petabytes of data commonly found nowadays is an onerous task
due to the prohibitive cost of data transfer. Currently this issue is alleviated by working with
reduced-resolution or reduced-precision data. This paper brings together techniques that reduce data
in resolution, precision, and both, into a common framework in which they can be studied and
compared. The error patterns of these techniques are compared with regards to fundamental metrics, namely L2 norm,
first and second derivatives, histograms, and isocontours. We also compute and study
metric-dependent streams which serve as empirical bounds on the limit to which
reduction can happen, given an error tolerance for the analysis task at hand. Finally, based on the
observed characteristics of those streams, we propose practical heuristics to minimize the amount of
data needed to perform a given analysis task. The insights and heuristics presented here can be
leveraged to implement data-optimal representations and querying systems to facilitate interactive
exploration as well as cursory analysis of enormous data.%
